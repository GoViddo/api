Where a business is listed as 'EIS' or 'SEIS' on Crowdcube, this tax relief will be available to qualifying investors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of these schemes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EIS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can claim up to 30% income tax relief on investments up to £1 million per tax year;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gain is Capital Gains Tax (CGT) free if the shares are held for at least three years;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the shares are disposed of at a loss (for example, if the company enters insolvent liquidation) you can elect that the amount of loss, less income tax relief, be set against any income tax of the year in which they were disposed of, or, on income of the previous year;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment of CGT can be deferred when the gain is invested in shares of an EIS qualifying company</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SEIS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can claim income tax relief of 50% on investments up to £100,000 per tax year;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain CGT benefits depending on the which tax year the investment was made.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are there any restrictions with claiming SEIS/EIS relief?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, you need to be a UK taxpayer in order to claim SEIS or EIS relief. Moreover, you will not be eligible for SEIS or EIS tax relief if you are connected with the company. You can find a detailed list of ineligibility factors in section 1.3 of the HMRC guide </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-enterprise-investment-scheme-introduction/enterprise-investment-scheme"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that the availability of any tax relief, including EIS and SEIS, depends on the individual circumstances of each investor and the company concerned, and may be subject to change in the future. If you have any questions regarding the availability of tax relief or the tax treatment of your investment, you should obtain independent tax advice before proceeding with your investment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Income Tax Relief</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no minimum investment through EIS in any one company in any one tax year. Tax relief of 30% can be claimed on investments (up to £1,000,000 in one tax year) giving a maximum tax reduction in any one year of £300,000, provided you have sufficient Income Tax liability to cover it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIS allowances are allocated individually; therefore a married couple could invest up to £2 million each tax year and be eligible for Income tax relief. The shares must be held for at least three years from the date of issue or the tax relief will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People connected with the company are not eligible for Income Tax Relief on their shares.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax exemption (CGT)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gain is CGT free if the shares are held for at least three years and the income tax relief was claimed on them. Shares can be held for much longer and therefore potentially enable the investor to accrue their CGT exemption over a long period of time which can be a great attraction. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) relief may also be available if you sell, give away, exchange or otherwise dispose of your shares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment of CGT can be deferred when the gain is invested in shares of an EIS qualifying company. The gain can be made from the disposal of any kind of asset but the Investment must be made one year before or three years after the gain arose - connection to the company does not matter. Unconnected investors are eligible for relief from both Income tax and CGT deferral relief.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="cc-collapse__item"><div class="cc-collapse__header"><a class="cc-collapse__link" href="#collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-1" role="tab">How do I claim EIS or SEIS on my investment?</a></div><div class="cc-collapse__body" role="tabpanel" id="collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-1"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have received an S/EIS certificate showing that your investment in a qualifying company has been approved by HMRC before you can make a claim for tax relief. In some cases there might be a delay in receiving your certificate as a company must have been trading for more than four months, or confirm that they have spent at least 70% of the funds raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have received the S/EIS3 certificate you will need to claim in one of two ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are submitting your own tax filings, you don't need to send the EIS certificate to HMRC along with your return - you will only need to send it if they request it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren't submitting your own tax filing, you need to complete pages 3&amp;4 and send to the office that deals with your PAYE. You can find this information on any previous correspondence you may have received from HMRC or your employer should also hold this information. </span><strong>Please note, we do not hold this information for investors.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in any doubt as to where to send your S/EIS certificate to please contact HMRC directly who will be able to provide you with the correct details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some rules that you should be aware of when it comes to claiming your tax relief:</span></p>
<p><strong>Share “Termination date”:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SEIS or EIS shares must be held for a minimum of three years to benefit from income tax relief, and as such should be seen as a long-term investment. The date you must retain your share until is shown in as the share termination date on your S/EIS certificate. If your shares are sold before you have held them for 3 years , you will have to inform HMRC and repay any income tax relief you have claimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Investor tax reference: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all investors will have an Investor tax reference number, please provide your National Insurance Number instead to allow HMRC to link your claim for tax relief to your income tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax relief for a different year – your choices: HMRC outline that there is a possibility to back date your claim for tax relief to previous tax years. There is a 'carry back' facility which allows all or part of the cost of shares acquired in one tax year, to be treated as though those shares had been acquired in the preceding tax year. Relief is then given against the Income Tax liability of that preceding year rather than against the tax year in which those shares were acquired. This is subject to the overriding limit for relief for each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are two examples...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example 1</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny invests £20,000 in the tax year 2012-13 (6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013) in SEIS qualifying shares. The SEIS relief available is £10,000 (£20,000 at 50 percent). Her tax liability for the year before SEIS relief is £15,000 which she can reduce to £5,000 (£15,000 less £10,000) as a result of her investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example 2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James invests £20,000 in the tax year 2012-13 in SEIS qualifying shares. The relief available is £10,000 as for Example 1. However his tax liability for the year before SEIS relief is £7,500. James can reduce his tax bill to zero as a result of his SEIS investment, but loses the rest of the relief available of £2,500 (£10,000 less £7,500).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please visit the HMRC website for more information regarding the process of claiming tax relief, which can be found </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-investment-scheme-income-tax-relief-hs341-self-assessment-helpsheet/hs341-enterprise-investment-scheme-income-tax-relief-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="cc-collapse__item"><div class="cc-collapse__header"><a class="cc-collapse__link" href="#collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-2" role="tab">When will I receive my EIS or SEIS certificate?</a></div><div class="cc-collapse__body" role="tabpanel" id="collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-2"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company must have been trading for 4 months or spent 70% of the funds they have raised before they can submit an SEIS/EIS application to HMRC</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing the company meets the above criteria, we will work with the company to prepare the necessary paperwork and submit an application for tax relief to HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the paperwork has been submitted,&nbsp; HMRC generally advises that they can take up to 45 working days to process the application. HMRC will then send approval to issue tax certificates, at which point we will make your certificate available to download from your portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you change your postal address, your tax relief certificate will update automatically when you have updated your Crowdcube account. Please also ensure you advise HMRC of a change of address.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find more information on how to claim EIS or SEIS on your investment once you have received your certificate </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-investment-scheme-income-tax-relief-hs341-self-assessment-helpsheet/hs341-enterprise-investment-scheme-income-tax-relief-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="cc-collapse__item"><div class="cc-collapse__header"><a class="cc-collapse__link" href="#collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-3" role="tab">What do 'EIS/SEIS Pending' and 'EIS/SEIS Partial' mean?</a></div><div class="cc-collapse__body" role="tabpanel" id="collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-3"><div class="column"><p><strong>Pending</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these instances the business has applied for EIS or SEIS advance assurance, but has yet to receive written confirmation. &nbsp;In these cases, confirmation of whether or not the company has received advance assurance will be given in the cooling off email sent to investors after the pitch closes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Partial</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these instances there is EIS or SEIS available for a portion, but not all, of the raise. For example, if a business raising £100,000 might have only £20,000 of that raise as EIS-eligible, then the page will display 'EIS Partial.'</span></p></div></div></div><div class="cc-collapse__item"><div class="cc-collapse__header"><a class="cc-collapse__link" href="#collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-4" role="tab">What is a dual SEIS and EIS raise?</a></div><div class="cc-collapse__body" role="tabpanel" id="collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-4"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies are in a position to offer both SEIS and EIS tax relief. SEIS will be offered to investors on a first come first served basis. When the allowance for SEIS has been reached investors will be allocated EIS in its place. Confirmation of your tax relief allocation will be confirmed to you in your cooling off email, providing you with the opportunity to review your investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status of dual raises will be shown on the pitch page, where it will show both SEIS and EIS availability for investors. Companies can have a maximum allowance of £150,000 to offer under the SEIS scheme, which can attract a large number of investors in a short amount of time. The amount of SEIS that is available to investors can be lower than £150,000 if the company has previously claimed through the tax scheme before our raise of investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On an SEIS/EIS dual raise, all payments are collected after the cooling off period has expired. We then release the SEIS eligible funds to the company and issue these shares before remaining funds are released and EIS shares are issued. Other than the different tax relief schemes, all investments (SEIS and EIS) are made on the same terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualifying companies can issue a maximum of £150,000 of SEIS eligible share in their lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies offering&nbsp; SEIS shares allocate the tax relief on a&nbsp; first-come-first-served basis to investors. Investors who invest after the remaining SEIS allowance has been exhausted are offered EIS eligible shares. We call this a dual SEIS and EIS raise.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company X has issued £50,000 of SEIS shares in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It decides to do a £300,000 raise on Crowdcube. The first £100,000 invested is potentially SEIS eligible. The additional £200,000 invested is potentially EIS eligible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a pitch closes, all investors receive an email to review their investment, summarising the tax relief that may be available on their investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will then collect all payments and release the SEIS funds to the company and issue the SEIS share certificates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the SEIS shares have been issued, the remaining £200,000 of EIS and non tax relief shares are then issued to these investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an individual investor makes 2 investments in the same pitch, one before and one after the remaining SEIS allowance has been exhausted, they will be treated as separate investments. This means that the shares&nbsp; for the SEIS and EIS investment will be issued on separate days, the investor will receive 2 separate share certificates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLEASE NOTE: The availability of any tax relief, including EIS and SEIS, depends on the individual circumstances of each investor and of the company concerned, and may be subject to change in the future. If you are in any doubt about the availability of any tax reliefs, or the tax treatment of your investment, you should obtain independent tax advice before proceeding with your investment.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="cc-collapse__item"><div class="cc-collapse__header"><a class="cc-collapse__link" href="#collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-5" role="tab">Are there any restrictions on claiming EIS/SEIS?</a></div><div class="cc-collapse__body" role="tabpanel" id="collapse-1c0e8602-405d-4a6c-a0f5-8f064446233e-5"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the restrictions on claiming EIS/SEIS are outlined below.</span></p>
<p><strong>Connection to the Company</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you be connected to the company, you are not eligible for Income Tax Relief. Connections are defined through financial interest or employment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Connection by financial interest<br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual is connected with the company if they control the company or hold more than 30% of the share capital or voting rights. These conditions apply for up to 2 years before and 3 years after the share issue. If during this time, the individual becomes connected, then the relief will be withdrawn. All relatives except brothers and sisters are included within these restrictions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Connection by employment<br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners, directors and employees of the company are all connected with it and therefore not eligible, as are associates. Associates are business partners, trustees and relatives. Again, these conditions apply for up to 2 years before and 3 years after the share issue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only exceptions are Business Angels – where the connection is as a director who receives no remuneration from the company.</span></p>
